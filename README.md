#What does this do?

It downloads ALL images from rule34 based on your searches and neatly organises them into folders. This code was forked from [DNAGamer](https://github.com/DNAGamer/), whose script has limit of 1k images.

#Disclaimer


I do not own nor am i afiliated with rule34, this is just a script to help people get way too much porn
